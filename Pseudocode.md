## Pseudocode

## I need to gather user input - this information needs to ask if the user picks rock, paper or scissors and provide
## an error code if other information is put in thats invalid.

## When the user has decided they will face the computer who randomly selects a number corresponding to rock, paper or scissors.

## An if statement will decide what beats what: Rock breaks scissors; paper breaks rock; scissors break paper.

## The user will then find their result, either a win, lose, draw and each outcome will correspond to a different colour: win = green; loss = red; draw = orange.

## Depending on the outcome of the game a point will be added to either the users, or computers score which the user will be able to see.

## The user can play infinitely until they decide to stop.
